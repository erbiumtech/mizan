/**
 * A newly provisioned company must come out usable, not merely created.
 *
 * The failure this exists for is quiet: a seeder is added to the codebase, wired
 * into nothing, and every new company thereafter is missing data that no test
 * notices because the tests seed what they need themselves. It has happened
 * twice — three companies were provisioned with no tax schedules at all because
 * TaxScheduleSeeder was added to the baseline after them, and the first personal
 * account came out with no banks and no spending categories.
 *
 * So these assert the reference data itself rather than the seeder list: a list
 * check would pass on a seeder that runs and produces nothing.
