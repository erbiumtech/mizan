/**
 * `public/storage` must not exist in this application.
 *
 * Uploads are served by TenantFileController, which checks that the caller is a
 * member of the company whose file they are asking for. The `storage:link`
 * symlink bypasses that entirely: with it in place, `storage/app/public` is
 * readable straight off the web root, and since a company's files live at
 * `storage/app/public/tenants/{id}/…`, anyone who knows a path could fetch
 * another company's payslips — which is precisely what TenantStorage's own
 * docblock says the streaming route exists to prevent.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. It was found as a real directory holding four
 * employees' payslip PDFs, served by the web server with no authentication in
 * front of them, four of which had also been committed to the repository.
 *
 * So `php artisan storage:link` is the wrong command for this application, and
 * this test is here to say so at the moment somebody runs it rather than months
 * later.
