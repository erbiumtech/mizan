/**
 * Chasing overdue invoices — `docs/erpnext-gap-plan.md` Phase 5, item 4.
 *
 * Everything this needed already existed: the ageing query, `EmailTemplate` for the wording, `InvoiceEvent`
 * as a dated log on the document, and a per-tenant scheduler. What was missing was the rule — who is chased,
 * when, and how often.
 *
 * The three that matter:
 *
 *  - **`test_nothing_is_sent_while_dunning_is_off`** — this is the only thing in the application that emails
 *    somebody outside the company, so the default has to be silence.
 *  - **`test_an_invoice_is_not_chased_again_inside_the_repeat_window`** — the repeat interval reads the event
 *    log rather than a column, which is what made this phase cheap; if it read nothing, a company would send
 *    a customer one reminder a day.
 *  - **`test_a_paid_invoice_is_never_chased`** — including the part-paid case, which changes the balance
 *    without changing the status.
