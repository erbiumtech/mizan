/**
 * Every permission name referenced in app/ must exist after PermissionSeeder runs.
 *
 * The failure this guards against is not a denied button: `hasPermissionTo()` *throws*
 * for a name the database has not got, so a permission checked in code and missing from
 * a module's `module.php` declaration is a 500 on every page that evaluates it. That is
 * exactly how the performance plan's Phase 0 was blocked — a seeder 96 permissions
 * behind whose only symptom was `There is no permission named 'HolidayView'`
 * (docs/page-load-performance-plan.md, "Still outstanding").
 *
 * The scan is deliberately narrow: string literals in the codebase's one convention —
 * a PascalCase name passed to a permission-checking method. Policy abilities and gate
 * names are lowercase-first (`view`, `setGlobal`, `viewHorizon`), so requiring a
 * leading capital keeps them out. A reference this regex cannot see (a name built at
 * runtime) is not asserted; better a reliable subset than false positives.
