/**
 * Variations and change orders — `docs/construction-management-plan.md` §9.
 *
 * One table for both, because they are the same thing under two names (§8.3).
 *
 * **The state that construction actually lives in is `approved_in_principle` with `is_price_provisional`**:
 * instructed, work proceeding, price disputed for four months. Modelling it as either approved or not "forces a
 * choice between certifying money nobody agreed and forecasting a cost the job is already incurring" — so it is
 * a state and a flag, and the rule that follows is the sharpest one in §9:
 *
 * **A provisionally priced variation is excluded from the certified contract sum and included in the
 * forecast.** Two named scopes carry it — `agreed()` and `forecast()` — and there is **no bare
 * `where('status', 'approved')` anywhere in the module**, which `ConstructionVariationTest` asserts against the
 * source. One boolean, two audiences, and conflating them is how a job reports a margin it does not have for
 * two quarters running.
 *
 * **Three money columns rather than one**, and NEC4 is the reason to keep them: quoted is what the contractor
 * asked, assessed is what the certifier decided, approved is what the parties agreed. A Project Manager's own
 * assessment under NEC4 is simply an assessed amount differing from the quoted one, which is why that regime
 * needs no schema change here (§11).
