 * provider returns an item with a URL — while this proposes an action and waits. That second beat is a
 * thing the palette has no concept of, so it gets its own component and shares the palette's render hook.
 *
 * **Nothing here books anything.** It calls {@see CommandInterpreter}, renders what came back, and calls
 * {@see CommandBooker} only when somebody presses Confirm. The gate is the whole point (§6): `bookRow()`
 * approves and posts on the spot, so there is no draft to reconsider afterwards.
