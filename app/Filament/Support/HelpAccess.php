/**
 * What the signed-in user may actually do with a given model, in words, for the
 * banner at the top of a help panel.
 *
 * Reads the permission names each policy method checks out of the policy's own
 * source, rather than calling the policy. That is deliberate and the whole
 * design rests on it:
 *
 *  - Calling the policy does not work. Several abilities combine a permission
 *    with the state of one record — JournalEntryPolicy::post() is
 *    `hasPermissionTo('JournalEntryPost') && $entry->canBePosted()` — so asking
 *    the Gate about a blank model tells a Manager they cannot post, which is
 *    the opposite of what is true of their role. A banner describes the role,
 *    not one record.
 *  - Hardcoding the names per screen does not work either. The naming is not
 *    uniform: CurrencyPolicy reuses AccountView/AccountCreate/AccountUpdate,
 *    TaxRate reuses the Invoice permissions, and Role uses viewAnyRole rather
 *    than RoleView. Reading the policy picks all of that up on its own and
 *    cannot drift when a policy is re-pointed.
 *
 * The same source-scanning trick ModuleCoverageTest already relies on to find
 * every permission the application checks, applied to one class at a time.
 *
 * A policy that authorises by role instead of permission (EmailTemplatePolicy
 * is `isAdministrator()`) yields no permission names and therefore no banner
 * rows, which is correct: there is nothing granular to report.
