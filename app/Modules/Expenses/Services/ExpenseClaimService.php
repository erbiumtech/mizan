/**
 * Getting an approved claim paid.

 * Reimbursement rides on the payslip, because that is where the money already
 * reached the employee: `payslips.expense_reimbursement` existed before claims did
 * and is already added to net pay and posted by PayrollPostingService. What was
 * missing was any record of what the figure was for.
 *
 * The shape is AdvanceService's, for the same reason: payroll recalculates a payslip
 * on every save, so anything attached to one has to be idempotent per payslip or the
 * employee is reimbursed twice.
 *
 * **Payroll asks; it does not name this class.** `expenses` requires `payroll`, so Payroll reaching back here
 * was a two-cycle between a module and the one it declares — the last one in the application, with the
 * identical one through Advances. Bound to `App\Support\Contracts\ReimbursableClaims` from
 * `ExpensesServiceProvider`; see docs/module-packaging-plan.md §11. The licence guard lives here rather than
 * in Payroll's model hooks, as it does in `PayrollRunPeriodLock`.
