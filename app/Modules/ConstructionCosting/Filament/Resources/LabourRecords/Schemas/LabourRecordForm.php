/**
 * A day, a person, a code and some minutes.
 *
 * **Time is asked for in minutes** and the helper text says the common values, because that is what the column holds
 * and a form that asked for hours would put the rounding §7.1 rejects right back at the entry point.
 *
 * The rate is **not** on this form. It is resolved at approval, as at the day worked, and frozen there — so a form
 * field for it would be either a lie or a second place for the same figure to live. The panel below shows what the
 * ladder currently says instead, which is a preview and labelled as one.
