/**
 * Site sheets in, job cost out — `docs/construction-management-plan.md` §7.1 and §7.3.
 *
 * Four rules live here rather than in a form, because the site sheet, the timesheet import of §7.1 and any future API
 * are three callers and a rule kept in one of them is a rule the other two walk past.
 *
 *  - **Approval snapshots the rate, and nothing recomputes afterwards.** §7.2's dated table stops a wage revision
 *    restating history; this snapshot is what holds when somebody edits the rate row itself. `labour_rate_id` records
 *    which row it came from, so the figure can be traced rather than trusted.
 *  - **Two entries, never one** (§7.3). Labour, and burden as its own entry against the same cost code flagged
 *    `is_burden`. "Labour cost" stays one number and burden stays separable, and neither has to be backed out of the
 *    other by a report.
 *  - **No rate means refusal, not zero.** An hour with no rate cannot be costed, and a week of labour at 0.00 is
 *    §18.1's healthy-looking figure hiding an absence — the one failure mode this whole section is arranged around.
 *  - **A correction is a reversal.** §3.3's rule: once cost is booked the record keeps its row, both entries are
 *    reversed as a pair, and the reason is on the record.
 *
 * **Burden is `pending`, not `memo`**, and that was a contradiction inside the plan until Phase 7b resolved it: §7.3
 * requires burden charged to jobs to credit Labour Burden Absorbed, so it has a GL side and §11's posting service is
 * what writes it. See `CostEntry::GL_MEMO`, whose comment named burden as an example and was the error.
