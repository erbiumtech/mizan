     * and its name was built from a `pay_period` attribute that does not exist,
     * which left the month out and collapsed every month of a fiscal year onto one
     * file per employee — August's download was July's PDF.
     *
     * Listing no longer renders anything either. It used to render a PDF for every
     * payslip missing one, so the first call of a new fiscal year rendered a year
     * of them before it answered.
