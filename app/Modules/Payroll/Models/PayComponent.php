/**
 * One part of pay: an allowance, or a deduction.
 *
 * The shipped ones are marked `is_column_backed` — basic wage, the four allowances,
 * bonus, extra work, and the four deductions all still live in their own columns on
 * EmployeeSetting and Payslip, and the calculation still reads those. They are rows
 * here so the set of things pay is made of is complete, reportable, and knows where
 * it posts.
 *
 * Anything added afterwards is not column-backed, and *is* driven from here: an
 * amount per employee, a total on the payslip, and a place in the ledger. That is
 * the point — a new allowance is a row, not a migration and twelve edits.
