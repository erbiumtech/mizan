     * What this module adds to the Employees screens, registered here rather than declared there.
     *
     * `employees -> payroll` was the linchpin of the seven-module cycle left after phase 9, and it was two
     * references: `EmployeeSetting::components()`, a hasMany onto a model this module ships, and the
     * added-components relation manager, which offered `PayComponent`. Payroll **requires** Employees, so
     * both were cycles — and both were written with fully-qualified class names precisely so the import would
     * not show, which phase 0's scan sees through and which the plan names for what it is.
     *
     * Deleting it freed four other modules at once: accounting, attendance and leave were each held in only
     * by a three-cycle running back through here. Same shape as Core in phase 9.
     *
     * Registered unconditionally, like every provider in this application — one deployment serves every
     * company and the licence check belongs on the resource. What this guarantees is the useful property: if
     * the Payroll **package** is absent, neither the relation nor the tab exists, which is correct, because
     * the rows they read live in tables this module ships.
     *
     * The foreign key is named explicitly. `hasMany()` infers it from the *calling method's* name, and inside
     * a closure that name is `{closure}` — the phase 8C failure, recorded so it is not rediscovered.
