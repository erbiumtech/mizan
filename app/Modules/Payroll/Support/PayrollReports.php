/**
 * Payroll's three reports, as the Reports explorer draws them.
 *
 * These were methods on `Accounting\Support\ReportPane`, which meant Accounting imported
 * `WithholdingTaxSummary`, `SalaryBankExportService` and `Payslip` in order to render reports it does not
 * own. See docs/module-packaging-plan.md §8 Group A. They are registered with
 * `App\Support\Reporting\ReportRenderers` by PayrollServiceProvider, so a company without Payroll has
 * three fewer reports rather than three that fail.
 *
 * The look is unchanged because the shapes are shared — `ReportShapes` is the same code the pane used,
 * moved to where both can reach it.
