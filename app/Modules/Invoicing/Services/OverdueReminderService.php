/**
 * Chasing overdue invoices — `docs/erpnext-gap-plan.md` Phase 5, and the cheapest item on it.
 *
 * Almost everything this needed already existed: `EmailTemplate` lets a company write its own wording,
 * `InvoiceEvent` is a dated log already shown on the document, `Contact::correspondenceEmail()` knows where
 * to write, and `schedule:run` runs a command once per tenant. What was missing was the *rule* — who gets
 * chased, when, and how often — which is this class and three settings.
 *
 * **It queries rather than reusing `aging()`, which is the one reuse that did not fit.** That method buckets
 * a whole book and returns totals; a reminder needs one row per invoice with the days on it, and asking for
 * the buckets to get at the rows would compute a report to send an email.
 *
 * **Off until a company turns it on.** `invoicing.dunning_enabled` defaults to false, so no customer of any
 * existing company receives anything because this shipped. That is the gap plan's constraint, and it matters
 * more here than in any other phase: the failure mode of getting this wrong is an email to somebody else's
 * customer.
 *
 * **The repeat interval reads the event log rather than a column.** A reminder is recorded as an
 * `InvoiceEvent`, so "when did we last chase this?" is a question the document already answers. No
 * migration, and the answer is visible to a person on the invoice's own history — which is where somebody
 * arguing with a customer about it will look.
 *
 * **No interest and no fee.** ERPNext's Dunning books both through the payment's deductions. That is a
 * posting decision — what rate, from when, to which account, and what happens to a customer who pays the
 * invoice but not the interest — and §4 of the plan says to take the reminder and leave the charge until
 * somebody actually charges one. Nothing here posts anything.
