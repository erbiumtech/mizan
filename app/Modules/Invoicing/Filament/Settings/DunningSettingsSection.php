/**
 * Whether and when to chase overdue invoices — `docs/erpnext-gap-plan.md` Phase 5.
 *
 * Three settings, and the first is the important one: **off by default**. This is the only thing in the
 * application that emails somebody who is not a member of the company, so it cannot be a feature that starts
 * working because a deploy happened. A company switches it on having read what it says.
 *
 * The wording of the letter is not here. It is an `EmailTemplate` (`invoice_overdue`), where every other
 * company-specific wording lives, and the shipped text is sent until somebody writes their own.
 *
 * **No interest and no fee**, which is where this stops being ERPNext's Dunning. Theirs books both through
 * the payment's deductions; that is a posting decision and §4 of the plan says to leave it until somebody
 * charges one. Adding fields for them here would promise arithmetic nothing does.
