 * Overdue reminders, daily — docs/erpnext-gap-plan.md Phase 5.
 *
 * Daily rather than weekly because the *interval* is a company setting: the job asks each day who is past
 * due and has not been chased inside their repeat window, so a company wanting fortnightly reminders sets
 * fourteen days rather than needing this line changed. Sends nothing at all unless the company has switched
 * dunning on — the only scheduled job here that writes to somebody outside the company.
 *
 * Mid-morning on purpose: a payment chase that arrives at 3am reads as automated, which is a worse first
 * impression than the same sentence at 10.
