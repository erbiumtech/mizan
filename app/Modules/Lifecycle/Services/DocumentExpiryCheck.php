     * true — `due()` says so about its own smallest threshold, and a listing has even less excuse to drop
     * one.

     * The window defaults to the widest configured threshold, so the report covers exactly the population
     * the reminders watch: a company that widens `lifecycle.document_expiry_thresholds` widens both at once
