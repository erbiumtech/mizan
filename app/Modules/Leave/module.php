/**
 * What this module is, and what it owns.
 *
 * Requires Employees and nothing else. Payroll is deliberately NOT declared:
 * leave is worth having for the register, the balances and the approvals on
 * their own, and the company running this in production docks nothing for
 * unpaid absence today. The payroll join — pro-rating pay on lop_days — is a
 * later phase, guarded at its call site rather than declared here, so leave
 * stays sellable to a company that runs no payroll at all.
 * See docs/hrms-plan.md §2 and §5.
 *
 * Merged by App\Support\ModuleManifest. See docs/module-packaging-plan.md §5.
