 * Everything the Leave module owns that Filament does not discover.
 *
 * Policies are registered EXPLICITLY. Laravel guesses App\Models\X ->
 * App\Policies\XPolicy, which cannot resolve a model living in a module directory,
 * and Filament treats a model with no policy as allowed — so without this map every
 * resource here would be open to any authenticated user. ModuleCoverageTest fails the
 * build if one is missing, which is how this was caught in this codebase before.
