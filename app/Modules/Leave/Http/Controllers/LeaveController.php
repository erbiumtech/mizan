 * docs/hrms-plan.md §11: leave balance and apply-for-leave are the obvious next

 * web-only feature in a phone-first market. Both are scoped to the signed-in
 * employee the way PayslipController is — the caller's employee record, nobody
 * else's — and filing goes through LeaveRequestService::submit(), so the API gets
 * the same notice check, overlap refusal and approver notification the panel gets.
