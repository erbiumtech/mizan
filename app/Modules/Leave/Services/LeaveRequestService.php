 * JournalEntryService's — both deliberately, because both are built and tested here
 * and a third way of doing either would be a third thing to get wrong.
 *
 * The one thing this adds to that pattern is that approval *generates* something: the
 * leave_days rows, from the holiday calendar and the sandwich setting as they stand
 * at that moment. Those inputs are read once here and never again, which is the whole
 * of docs/hrms-plan.md §4.7's rule — a setting decides what happens next, never what
