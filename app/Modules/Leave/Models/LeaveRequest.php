/**
 * Somebody asking to be away.
 *
 * The status vocabulary is ExpenseClaim's, verbatim, because a second vocabulary for
 * the same idea is how one module ends up saying `rejected` where another says
 * `refused` — which four approval flows in this codebase already do
 * (docs/hrms-plan.md §11).
 *
 * Deciding a request lives in LeaveRequestService rather than on this model, which
 * is where it differs from ExpenseClaim. An approval here generates leave_days from
 * the holiday calendar and the sandwich setting, and writes an activity entry when a
 * self-approval was waived — three collaborators, which is a service. The model
 * keeps the vocabulary, the relations and the predicates the policy reads.
