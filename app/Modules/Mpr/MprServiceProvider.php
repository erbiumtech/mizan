/**
 * Everything the MPR module owns that Filament does not discover: its policies
 * and its routes.
 *
 * Policies are registered EXPLICITLY, and that is not a style preference.
 * Laravel guesses App\Models\X -> App\Policies\XPolicy; once a model lives in
 * App\Modules\Mpr\Models the guess never resolves, and Filament treats a model
 * with no policy as allowed. This exact class is the precedent: MprPolicy was
 * already registered by hand because the guess produced MPRPolicy, and on a
 * case-sensitive filesystem "the resource is open to everyone". Every module
 * provider therefore carries its own map, and ModuleCoverageTest fails the build
 * if a model behind a resource has no policy registered.
