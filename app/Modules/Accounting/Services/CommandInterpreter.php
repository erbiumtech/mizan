/**
 * Sentence in, {@see CommandInterpretation} out — `docs/ai-command-bot-plan.md` §3, §7.
 *
 * **A router, not a translator.** It picks the resolver an utterance belongs to, asks it for its schema
 * and its half of the prompt, makes one model call, and hands the reply back to the same resolver. It
 * knows nothing about cash, claims, or any module's slots — §7's "the bot routes; it does not learn every
 * module's schema", enforced by having nowhere to put that knowledge.
 *
 * Two properties fall out of routing *before* the model call rather than inside it. The prompt only ever
 * carries one resolver's reference data, so it stays small; and a module this tenant has not licensed
 * contributes nothing to it at all, so the reply cannot leak the module list.
