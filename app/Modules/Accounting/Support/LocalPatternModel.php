/**
 * The command parser with no model behind it — `docs/ai-command-bot-plan.md` §4, local driver.
 *
 * **This is the default, and the API is the upgrade.** Not a fallback or a degraded mode: for the commands
 * this feature was actually asked for — "rent 25000 out", "کرایہ ۲۵ ہزار دیا" — three or four tokens with
 * one job each, it is *better* than a model call on every axis that matters here:
 *
 *  - **Deterministic.** The same words always produce the same entry. For something that posts money that
 *    is worth more than flexibility; a model that is right 98% of the time is a ledger with an unexplained
 *    2% in it.
 *  - **Free, instant, offline.** No key, no per-command cost, no round trip, nothing to rate-limit, and it
 *    keeps working when the network does not.
 *  - **Readable.** When it mis-parses, the reason is a word list somebody can look at and a rule somebody
 *    can change. A model's mistake is not inspectable.
 *
 * Every part it needs already existed and none of it was written for this class: {@see CommandGrammar}'s
 * `DIRECTION_WORDS` is a map, {@see AmountWords} is a pure parser, and the category aliases are a table.
 * The model was only ever deciding *which token is which* — and in a command this short, position and a
 * word list decide that.
 *
 * **Where it genuinely loses.** Free-form sentences: "I paid the landlord twenty-five thousand yesterday
 * for the new office" needs to know that "the landlord" implies rent and that "twenty-five thousand" is a
 * number. This returns null for the category there and asks, which is the right failure — but a model
 * would have answered. Switch drivers when commands start looking like sentences rather than commands.
 *
 * It implements {@see StructuredModel} and returns the same shape, so nothing downstream knows the
 * difference: the resolvers, the sign rules, the confirmation and the booking are unchanged.
 *
 * **In Accounting rather than beside the interface it implements, and `ModuleBoundaryTest` is why.** This
 * started in `App\Support\Ai`, next to `Claude` and `StructuredModel` — and it is the one driver in that
 * directory that is not generic: it reads {@see CommandGrammar}'s direction words, {@see AmountWords},
 * and `transaction_types`. Shared code that needs a module's classes is that module's code, or every other
 * module depends on Accounting through the back door. The *interface* stays shared, which is the part that
 * has to be: a second driver for another module's commands would implement the same one from its own
 * directory. The container binding lives in a provider, which is the layer that exists to wire modules
 * together and is exempt for that reason.
