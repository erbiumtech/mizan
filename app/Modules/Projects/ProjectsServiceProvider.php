     * make an Employee know about a Project lives here now:
     *
     *  - the three relations, added to the model at boot rather than declared on it. `Model::__call()`
     *    consults the relation resolvers before falling through to the query builder
     *    (`vendor/laravel/framework/.../Model.php:2833`), so `$employee->projects()` keeps working
     *    exactly as before — and stops existing when this module is not installed, which is correct.
     *  - the Projects tab on the Employee screen, through the slot EmployeeResource offers.
     *
     * Registered unconditionally, like every other provider in this application: one deployment serves
     * every company and the tenant is resolved per request, so the *licence* check belongs on the
     * resource (BelongsToModule) rather than here. What this guarantees is the weaker and more useful
     * property — if the Projects **package** is absent, none of it is registered at all.
