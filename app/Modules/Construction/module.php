/**
 * What this module is, and what it owns.
 *
 * Merged by App\Support\ModuleManifest. See docs/module-packaging-plan.md §5.
 *
 * **The spine of the construction suite, and it requires nothing.** That is
 * `docs/construction-management-plan.md` §18's one architectural decision, and the precedent is CRM's,
 * stated in the same terms: a contractor buying site management, document control and safety while keeping
 * its books in another system is a real and common customer. Requiring `accounting` here would undo the
 * self-contained decision of §1 in the registry, where it is least visible.
 *
 * The four modules that build on this one declare it: `construction_costing` (which does require
 * `accounting`, genuinely — job costing with no books is a spreadsheet), `construction_contracts`,
 * `construction_field` and `construction_qhse`.
 *
 * **The document register lives here, not in the field module** — §18 again. RFIs reference drawings,
 * submittals *are* documents, transmittals carry contract notices and ITPs reference
 * approved-for-construction drawings, so a customer who bought contracts and quality but not site
 * operations would otherwise have no register at all.
