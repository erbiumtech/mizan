 * Who may read, change and publish a document.

 * Published is the state that means "build this" (§15), so it is the same segregation the journal-entry powers
 * already keep: the person who records is not the person who authorises.
 *
 * The state machine's rules are *not* here. `DocumentStateMachine` decides what is allowed; this decides who
 * may ask. Mixing them would mean a permission grant silently skipping an approval gate.
