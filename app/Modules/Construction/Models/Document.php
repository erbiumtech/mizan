/**
 * One information container in the ISO 19650 register — `docs/construction-management-plan.md` §15.
 *
 * The four states are the standard's: **work in progress → shared → published → archived**, with an approval
 * gate between shared and published. The transitions are enforced in `DocumentStateMachine`, never here and
 * never in a form — §15 says so, and the reason is that a form-level rule is bypassed by every other caller
 * (an import, a command, a transmittal action) and nothing reports it.
 *
 * **Published is the only state a construction-issue drawing may be in.** An inspection, an RFI answer or a
 * punch item referencing a work-in-progress drawing is a defect waiting to be built.
