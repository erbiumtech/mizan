 * Scheduled and emailed reports — `docs/reports-expansion-plan.md` Phase 8, item 5.
 *
 * **One entry for every schedule in every company.** The command asks which schedules are due and dispatches
 * only those, which is the `CheckEnvironmentsHealth` shape and the reason a thousand schedules still need one
 * line here rather than a scheduler entry per row.
 *
 * Every fifteen minutes, so `ReportSchedule::isDueAt()` matches against a fifteen-minute window: a report set
 * for 07:00 fires on the 07:00 run and not four times an hour. Finer would mean more work for no gain — nobody
 * schedules a report to the minute — and coarser would make a timetable's stated time a rough one.
 *
 * **This needs `schedule:run` on cron AND a running queue worker** (`QUEUE_CONNECTION` defaults to
 * `database`). Said out loud because the failure is otherwise silent in the worst way: the schedules are
 * listed, they say when they will next run, and nothing ever arrives. `report_deliveries` is where to look —
 * no rows means the command never ran, rows stuck at `pending` means the worker is not consuming.
