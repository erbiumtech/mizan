/**
 * Claims in, certificates out — `docs/construction-management-plan.md` §10.
 *
 * Four rules live here, and each of them is a way a certificate goes wrong that nobody notices.
 *
 *  - **Cumulative in, movement derived.** Every figure written is "to date". A corrected certificate 6 is
 *    absorbed by certificate 7's movement rather than compounding through every later total.
 *  - **Draft computes, issue freezes.** A draft follows the schedule and the claim; an issued certificate is a
 *    statement of a moment that a third party countersigned, and nothing may restate it.
 *  - **Only agreed variations reach the certified sum.** `variations_net_to_date` reads `agreed()`, never
 *    `forecast()` — a provisionally priced variation belongs in the cost report, not in a certificate (§9).
 *  - **The previous figures are snapshotted, not joined.** Column D prints from `previous_work_value` so that
 *    voiding certificate 6 does not change what certificate 7 says — and a voided certificate is exactly when
 *    somebody reads the one after it.
 *
 * Retention movements are **not** written here. §11 makes `RetentionService` the only writer, and this service
 * produces the deduction row that service later attaches its movement to. Two write paths, one forgotten, and
 * nobody reads both registers in the same week.
 *
 * Issuing has two consequences outside this file, and both are calls rather than duplicated logic: the retention
 * movement above, and — on a subcontract — the **relief of the commitment behind it**, through
 * `CertificateCommitmentService`, which is guarded because `construction_costing` is sold separately (§5, §12).
 * Voiding runs the second one again, because the commitment target follows whichever certificate is now the
 * latest live one.
