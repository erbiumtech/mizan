/**
 * The module registry, assembled from what each module declares about itself.
 *
 * Every module ships an `app/Modules/{Name}/module.php` returning one array: its
 * registry entry, the classes it owns, the permissions it defines, the grants it
 * suggests. This class finds them, merges them and caches the result.
 *
 * It replaces six central files that every new module had to edit —
 * `config/modules.php`, the five hand-written tables in `ModuleMap`, the literal
 * rows in `PermissionSeeder`, the grants in `RoleSeeder` — which is where ten of
 * the thirteen steps in `docs/new-module-checklist.md` came from. A module is now
 * a directory and a file.
 *
 * Two design points worth stating, because both were forks:
 *
 * **A PHP file, not JSON and not a static method on the provider.** The entries
 * in `config/modules.php` carried paragraphs of load-bearing reasoning — why CRM
 * requires nothing, why Leave deliberately omits Payroll — and those paragraphs
 * are the most valuable content in that file. JSON cannot hold a comment, and a
 * static method would mean booting 22 provider classes to answer "what is this
 * module called", on a path `canAccess()` reaches.
 *
 * **The merged result is written back into `config('modules')`.** There are only
 * three readers of that key in the whole application, and none of them changes.
 * See ModuleManifestServiceProvider.
