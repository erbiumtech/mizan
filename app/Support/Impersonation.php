/**
 * Signing in as another user, so an administrator can complete work on behalf of
 * staff who cannot reasonably do it themselves — acknowledging a salary change,
 * filling in a profile.
 *
 * The original user's id is kept in the session, never the impersonated one, so
 * the way back does not depend on anything the impersonated session can alter.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not let you do:
 *
 *  - impersonate a super admin, from any starting point. A company Administrator
 *    who could would gain the whole platform, and a super admin gains nothing.
 *  - impersonate outside the company you are working in. Users are shared across
 *    companies, so without that check an Administrator of one company could sign
 *    in as somebody who merely happens to also work for another. A super admin is
 *    exempt: their reach is the installation, not a company (see canReach).
 *
 * Actions taken while impersonating are recorded against the impersonated user,
 * because that is whose data changed — but every audit entry additionally carries
 * `impersonated_by` (see ActivityLog), so an acknowledgement an administrator
 * made is never indistinguishable from one the employee made themselves. That
 * matters most for exactly the case this feature exists for: accepting a salary
 * change is a statement of consent, and the record has to show whose.
