 * A document to send, offered both ways, because the two providers want opposite

 * Meta takes the file: it is uploaded for a media id and the message refers to

 * checks the content-type header there before accepting the message.
 *
 * Both are lazy on purpose. The payslip PDF is rendered from the payslip as it
 * stands and never stored, so whichever the driver asks for is produced at the
 * moment it is asked for — and the one the driver does not use costs nothing.
